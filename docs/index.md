**Rollcall** is a **lightweight**, **local** address-book tailored to **tuition centres** that lets admin staff **add**, **find**, **schedule,** and **manage** students and staff. With **simple** text commands, it is **faster** and more **intuitive** than other spreadsheet softwares. It includes all the **essential** HR features without the hassle and complexity of fullblown HR software.

* If you are interested in using Rollcall, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Rollcall, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
