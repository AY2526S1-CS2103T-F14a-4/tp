* **Rollcall** is a **lightweight**, **local** address-book tailored to **tuition centres** that lets admin staff **add**, **find**, **schedule,** and **manage** students and staff.
* With **simple** text commands, it is **faster** and more **intuitive** than other spreadsheet softwares. It includes all the **essential** HR features without the hassle and complexity of fullblown HR software.
* Example usages:
  * Enrolling students into a tuition class
  * Marking students attendance
  * Keep track of students and staff finances
  * And many more features!
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Rollcall Product Website](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-f14a-4.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
